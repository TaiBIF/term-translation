organism:1		 Data Set	Organism		A particular organism or defined group of organisms considered to be taxonomically homogeneous.		Instances of the Organism class are intended to facilitate linking of one or more Identification instances to one or more Occurrence instances. Therefore, things that are typically assigned scientific names (such as viruses, hybrids, and lichens) and aggregates whose occurrences are typically recorded (such as packs, clones, and colonies) are included in the scope of this class. 				http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:Organism
organism:2		Organism	organismID	個體代碼	An identifier for the Organism instance (as opposed to a particular digital record of the Organism). May be a globally unique identifier or an identifier specific to the data set.	針對特定個體所賦予的代碼，					http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:organismID
organism:3		Organism	organismName		A textual name or label assigned to an Organism instance.				"Huberta",  "Boab Prison Tree",  "J pod".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:organismName
organism:4		Organism	organismScope		A description of the kind of Organism instance. Can be used to indicate whether the Organism instance represents a discrete organism or if it represents a particular type of aggregation. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary.		This term is not intended to be used to specify a type of taxon. To describe the kind of Organism using a URI object in RDF, use rdf:type (http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) instead. 		"multicellular organism",  "virus",  "clone" "pack",  "colony".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:organismScope
organism:5		Organism	associatedOccurrences		A list (concatenated and separated) of identifiers of other Occurrence records and their associations to this Occurrence.		The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').				http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:associatedOccurrences
organism:6		Organism	associatedOrganisms		A list (concatenated and separated) of identifiers of other Organisms and their associations to this Organism.		The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').		"sibling of MXA-232",  "mother of MXA-231 | mother of MXA-232".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:associatedOrganisms
organism:7		Organism	previousIdentifications	舊名	A list (concatenated and separated) of previous assignments of names to the Organism.	此筆出現紀錄之前被指派過的學名清單(使用標點符號分隔)。	The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').		"Chalepidae",  "Pinus abies",  "Anthus sp., field ID by G. Iglesias | Anthus correndera, expert ID by C. Cicero 2009-02-12 based on morphology".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:previousIdentifications
organism:8		Organism	organismRemarks		Comments or notes about the Organism instance.		Example: "One of a litter of six.".		"One of a litter of six."		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:organismRemarks
