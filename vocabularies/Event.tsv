event:7		Event	eventDate	資料產生日期	The date-time or interval during which an Event occurred. For occurrences, this is the date-time when the event was recorded.

event:8		Event	eventTime	事件時間	The time or interval during which an Event occurred. Recommended best practice is to use an encoding scheme, such as ISO 8601:2004(E).				"14:07-0600" is 2:07pm in the time zone six hours earlier than UTC,  "08:40:21Z" is 8:40:21am UTC,  "13:00:00Z/15:30:00Z" is the interval between 1pm UTC and 3:30pm UTC.		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:eventTime
event:9		Event	startDayOfYear		The earliest ordinal day of the year on which the Event occurred (1 for January 1, 365 for December 31, except in a leap year, in which case it is 366).				"1" (=1 Jan),  "366" (=31 Dec),  "365" (=30 Dec in a leap year, 31 Dec in a non-leap year).		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:startDayOfYear
event:10		Event	endDayOfYear		The latest ordinal day of the year on which the Event occurred (1 for January 1, 365 for December 31, except in a leap year, in which case it is 366).				"1" (=1 Jan),  "366" (=31 Dec),  "365" (=30 Dec in a leap year, 31 Dec in a non-leap year).		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:endDayOfYear
event:11		Event	year	年	The four-digit year in which the Event occurred, according to the Common Era Calendar.				"2008"		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:year
event:12		Event	month	月	The ordinal month in which the Event occurred.				"1" (=January),  "10" (=October).		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:month
event:13		Event	day	日	The integer day of the month on which the Event occurred.				"9",  "28".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:day
event:14		Event	verbatimEventDate	字面事件日期(原始)	The verbatim original representation of the date and time information for an Event.				"spring 1910",  "Marzo 2002",  "1999-03-XX",  "17IV1934".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:verbatimEventDate
event:15		Event	habitat	棲地類型描述	A category or description of the habitat in which the Event occurred.				"oak savanna",  "pre-cordilleran steppe".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:habitat
event:16		Event	samplingProtocol	採集方法	The name of, reference to, or description of the method or protocol used during an Event.

Guidelines for Nocturnal Owl Monitoring in North America.

event:17		Event	samplingEffort		The amount of effort expended during an Event.				"40 trap-nights",  "10 observer-hours; 10 km by foot; 30 km by car".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:samplingEffort
event:18		Event	sampleSizeValue		A numeric value for a measurement of the size (time duration, length, area, or volume) of a sample in a sampling event.		A sampleSizeValue must have a corresponding sampleSizeUnit.		"5" for sampleSizeValue with "metre" for sampleSizeUnit.		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:sampleSizeValue
event:19		Event	sampleSizeUnit		The unit of measurement of the size (time duration, length, area, or volume) of a sample in a sampling event.		A sampleSizeUnit must have a corresponding sampleSizeValue, e.g.,  "5" for sampleSizeValue with "metre" for sampleSizeUnit.		"minute",  "hour",  "day",  "metre",  "square metre",  "cubic metre". Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Ontology of Units of Measure http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/om-1.8/ of SI units, derived units, or other non-SI units accepted for use within the SI (e.g., minute, hour, day, litre).		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:sampleSizeUnit
