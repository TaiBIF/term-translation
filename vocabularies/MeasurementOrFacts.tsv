measurementorfact:1		 Data Set	MeasurementOrFact		A measurement of or fact about an rdfs:Resource (http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource).		Resources can be thought of as identifiable records or instances of classes and may include, but need not be limited to Occurrences, Organisms, MaterialSamples, Events, Locations, GeologicalContexts, Identifications, or Taxa.		The weight of an organism in grams. The number of placental scars. 		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:MeasurementOrFact
measurementorfact:2		MeasurementOrFact	measurementID	測量ID	An identifier for the MeasurementOrFact (information pertaining to measurements, facts, characteristics, or assertions). May be a global unique identifier or an identifier specific to the data set.						http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:measurementID
measurementorfact:3		MeasurementOrFact	measurementType	測量性質	The nature of the measurement, fact, characteristic, or assertion. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary.				"tail length",  "temperature",  "trap line length",  "survey area",  "trap type".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:measurementType
measurementorfact:4		MeasurementOrFact	measurementValue	測量數值	The value of the measurement, fact, characteristic, or assertion.				"45",  "20",  "1",  "14.5",  "UV-light".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:measurementValue
measurementorfact:5		MeasurementOrFact	measurementAccuracy	準確程度	The description of the potential error associated with the measurementValue.				"0.01",  "normal distribution with variation of 2 m".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:measurementAccuracy
measurementorfact:6		MeasurementOrFact	measurementUnit	測量單位	The units associated with the measurementValue. Recommended best practice is to use the International System of Units (SI).				"mm",  "C",  "km",  "ha".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:measurementUnit
measurementorfact:7		MeasurementOrFact	measurementDeterminedBy	執行者	A list (concatenated and separated) of names of people, groups, or organizations who determined the value of the MeasurementOrFact.		The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').		"Rob Guralnick",  "Julie Woodruff | Eileen Lacey".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:measurementDeterminedBy
measurementorfact:8		MeasurementOrFact	measurementDeterminedDate	日期	The date on which the MeasurementOrFact was made. Recommended best practice is to use an encoding scheme, such as ISO 8601:2004(E).				"1963-03-08T14:07-0600" is 8 Mar 1963 2:07pm in the time zone six hours earlier than UTC,  "2009-02-20T08:40Z" is 20 Feb 2009 8:40am UTC,  "1809-02-12" is 12 Feb 1809,  "1906-06" is Jun 1906,  "1971" is just that year,  "2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z" is the interval between 1 Mar 2007 1pm UTC and 11 May 2008 3:30pm UTC,  "2007-11-13/15" is the interval between 13 Nov 2007 and 15 Nov 2007.		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:measurementDeterminedDate
measurementorfact:9		MeasurementOrFact	measurementMethod	測量方法	A description of or reference to (publication, URI) the method or protocol used to determine the measurement, fact, characteristic, or assertion.				"minimum convex polygon around burrow entrances" for a home range area,  "barometric altimeter" for an elevation.		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:measurementMethod
measurementorfact:10		MeasurementOrFact	measurementRemarks	其它補充	Comments or notes accompanying the MeasurementOrFact.				"tip of tail missing".		http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:measurementRemarks
