record-level:13:Term	collectionCode		The name, acronym, coden, or initialism identifying the collection or data set from which the record was derived.
record-level:14:Term	datasetName		The name identifying the data set from which the record was derived.
record-level:15:Term	ownerInstitutionCode		The name (or acronym) in use by the institution having ownership of the object(s) or information referred to in the record.
record-level:16:Term	basisOfRecord		The specific nature of the data record.
record-level:17:Term	informationWithheld		Additional information that exists, but that has not been shared in the given record.
record-level:18:Term	dataGeneralizations		Actions taken to make the shared data less specific or complete than in its original form. Suggests that alternative data of higher quality may be available on request.
record-level:19:Term	dynamicProperties		A list of additional measurements, facts, characteristics, or assertions about the record. Meant to provide a mechanism for structured content.
