occurrence:2:Definition	An identifier for the Occurrence (as opposed to a particular digital record of the occurrence). In the absence of a persistent global unique identifier, construct one from a combination of identifiers in the record that will most closely make the occurrenceID globally unique.	TDWG 定義生物出現紀錄 (occurrence) 為「特定生物於特定時間存在於特定地點」。而為確保資料集中生物出現紀錄的唯一性，需要至少在資料集內部為獨一無二的識別碼，此即 occurrenceID。	
occurrence:3:Definition	An identifier (preferably unique) for the record within the data set or collection.	於資料集或館藏品中紀錄的識別碼（具唯一性者佳）。	
occurrence:4:Definition	An identifier given to the Occurrence at the time it was recorded. Often serves as a link between field notes and an Occurrence record, such as a specimen collector's number.	在 TDWG 釋出的 DwC 官方文件中，record 帶有「現地紀錄」或「於現地所做紀錄」的意涵。由此衍生，recordNumber 係指紀錄者在紀錄產生當下配賦給紀錄的編碼。	
occurrence:5:Definition	A list (concatenated and separated) of names of people, groups, or organizations responsible for recording the original Occurrence. The primary collector or observer, especially one who applies a personal identifier (recordNumber), should be listed first.	記錄出現記錄的人名、團體或組織名單(以標點符號分隔)。本名單之第一順位應是賦予此筆紀錄個人識別碼(紀錄編號(recordNumber)的人名、團體或組織名字。
