organism:8:Definition	Comments or notes about the Organism instance.		
organism:1:Comments	Instances of the Organism class are intended to facilitate linking of one or more Identification instances to one or more Occurrence instances. Therefore, things that are typically assigned scientific names (such as viruses, hybrids, and lichens) and aggregates whose occurrences are typically recorded (such as packs, clones, and colonies) are included in the scope of this class. 		
organism:4:Comments	This term is not intended to be used to specify a type of taxon. To describe the kind of Organism using a URI object in RDF, use rdf:type (http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) instead. 		
organism:5:Comments	The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').		
organism:6:Comments	The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').		
organism:7:Comments	The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').		
organism:8:Comments	Example: "One of a litter of six.".		
organism:3:Examples	"Huberta",  "Boab Prison Tree",  "J pod".		
organism:4:Examples	"multicellular organism",  "virus",  "clone" "pack",  "colony".		
organism:6:Examples	"sibling of MXA-232",  "mother of MXA-231 | mother of MXA-232".		
organism:7:Examples	"Chalepidae",  "Pinus abies",  "Anthus sp., field ID by G. Iglesias | Anthus correndera, expert ID by C. Cicero 2009-02-12 based on morphology".
