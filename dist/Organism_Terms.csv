organism:8:Definition of organismRemarks (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:organismRemarks)	Comments or notes about the Organism instance.		
organism:1:Comments of Organism (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:Organism)	Instances of the Organism class are intended to facilitate linking of one or more Identification instances to one or more Occurrence instances. Therefore, things that are typically assigned scientific names (such as viruses, hybrids, and lichens) and aggregates whose occurrences are typically recorded (such as packs, clones, and colonies) are included in the scope of this class. 		
organism:4:Comments of organismScope (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:organismScope)	This term is not intended to be used to specify a type of taxon. To describe the kind of Organism using a URI object in RDF, use rdf:type (http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) instead. 		
organism:5:Comments of associatedOccurrences (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:associatedOccurrences)	The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').		
organism:6:Comments of associatedOrganisms (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:associatedOrganisms)	The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').		
organism:7:Comments of previousIdentifications (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:previousIdentifications)	The recommended best practice is to separate the values with a vertical bar (' | ').		
organism:8:Comments of organismRemarks (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:organismRemarks)	Example: "One of a litter of six.".		
organism:3:Examples of organismName (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:organismName)	"Huberta",  "Boab Prison Tree",  "J pod".		
organism:4:Examples of organismScope (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:organismScope)	"multicellular organism",  "virus",  "clone" "pack",  "colony".		
organism:6:Examples of associatedOrganisms (http://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:associatedOrganisms)	"sibling of MXA-232",  "mother of MXA-231 | mother of MXA-232".
